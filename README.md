# Tableau-Project-for-Sharif
This repository contains my Tableau assignment for Data Science Expert course at Sharif Center of Technical and Applied Education.
In this assignment we wanted to answer 12 questions related to the data of pharmaceutical companys, as follow:
1. What are the top five products in terms of Rial and numeric sales?
2. Show the sales trend in Rials.
3. In what year, although Rial sales increased but sales did not increase in number? Which products is this related to?
4. Should the mean or median be used to analyze Rial sales data?
5. Has the sales trend of the number of manufactured drugs been growing over the years or not? When was it below the average?
6. Which companies had the best-selling drug sales share?
7. Specify what years 80% of sales were related to?
8. Classify drugs based on your expert attitude.
9. What are your sales forecasts for the next three years?
10. What company was the expensive medicine from?
11. Does the sale in Rials necessarily increase with the increase in sales of a number of manufactured drugs?
12. If you were one of the decision makers in the field of medicine, to which drugs and to which companies would you allocate drug subsidies?
